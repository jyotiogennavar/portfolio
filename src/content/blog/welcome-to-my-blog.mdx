# Welcome to My Blog

Welcome to my corner of internet.
I decided to be a software engineer when i was 10 because my Dad was one.
Fast forward 15 years i have completed my engineering and now work as a Senior Web developer.

i am person with many talents and many more interests. And i will do my best to share them all here.

My 2026 plan is to write a lot, about my learnings, projects and experiences building them.
I will be writing about everything Frontend related in efforts to learn more and help others along in their journeys.
