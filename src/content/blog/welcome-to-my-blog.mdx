# Welcome to My Blog

This is my first blog post using MDX in my portfolio website. MDX allows me to write content using Markdown syntax while also being able to use React components when needed.

## Features

- Write content in Markdown
- Use React components
- Syntax highlighting
- And much more!

## Code Example

```javascript
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, World!");
}
```

## What's Next?

I'll be writing more posts about:
- Web Development
- React
- Next.js
- And other interesting topics!

Stay tuned for more content!
